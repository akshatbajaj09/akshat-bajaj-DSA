# Linear Search:
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Binary Search:
# Time complexity: O(logn)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Although O(n) is ok for smaller datasets but for larger datasets
# O(logn) is much more efficient.

# Important condition for Binary Search:
# The array must be sorted.
