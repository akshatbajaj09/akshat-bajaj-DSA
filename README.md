Practicing DSA.
Journaling my daily progress.

## Day 1:

- Did the setup for Leetcode.
- Studied the basics of time and space complexities.
- Practiced problems from the Arrays 101 track of Leetcode.

## Day 2:

- Practiced problems on arrays:
  - Reverse String
  - Two Sum
  - Move Zeroes
  - Contains Duplicate

## Day 3:

- Practiced problem on array:
  - Duplicate Zeros

## Day 4:

- Solved 3 more questions:
  - Richest Customer Wealth
  - Merge Sorted Array
  - Remove Element (approach was similar to the one in Move Zeroes).

## Day 5:

- Solved the following problems:
  - Intersection of Two Arrays
  - First Unique Character in a String
- Summed up my learnings on different ways to swap two numbers in a single file.

## Day 6:

- Solved the following probelms:
  - Fizz Buzz
  - Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
  - How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
  - Count the Digits That Divide a Number
  - Palindrome Number
  - Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer

## Day 7:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

## Day 8:

- Solved the following problems:
  - N-th Tribonacci Number
  - Power of Two

## Day 9:

- Solved my first medium-level problem:
  - Pow(x, n)

## Day 10:

- Solved the following problems:
  - Running Sum of 1d Array
  - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Day 11:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Defanging an IP Address

## Day 12:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Valid Anagram

## Day 13:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

## Day 14:

- Solved the following problems:
  - Sort Array By Parity
  - Maximum Subarray

## Day 15:

- Solved the following problems:
  - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
  - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
  - Concatenation of Array

## Day 16:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Valid Palindrome

## Day 17:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Spiral Matrix

## Day 18:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

## Day 19:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

- Revised the following problems:
  - Concatenation of Array
  - Contains Duplicate
  - Valid Anagram
  - Two Sum

## Day 20:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Group Anagrams
 
## Day 21:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Fruit Into Baskets

## Day 22:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Majority Element

## Day 23:

- Solved the following problem:
  - Longest Common Prefix

## Day 24:

- Tried the following problem:
  - Sort an Array
  - Learnt 3 sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort.
All of them had these had the time complexity of O(n^2) but the question demanded O(nlogn) and hence I was not able to solve it but I will try again later.

## Day 25:

- Learnt two new sorting algorithms:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Solved the following problem:
  - Sort an Array (used merge sort to satisfy O(nlogn)).

## Day 26:

- Revised old problems.
- Observed similarity in the logic of Move Zeroes, Remove Element, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II, and Sort Array By Parity.

## Day 27:

- Revised old problems.
- Reviewed the other method for Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II.

## Day 28:

- Revised old problems.  
  (No new code was written, hence no separate folder for Day28.)

## Day 29:

- Learnt about a new algorithm: Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm.
- Solved the problem of Majority Element using 4 different approaches:
  - Hashing
  - Recursion
  - Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm
  - Sorting
- Revised other old problems too.
